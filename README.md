pyConway
======

A simple Python script to generate a Conway's game of life cellular automaton

Class Conway is initialized by passing the number of squares in which cells are born. 
The initBoard member specifies how densely the grid is populated at start, and randomly positions the cells in the grid.
At this point just call drawGrid to show the grid and nextStep to go to the next time step.
